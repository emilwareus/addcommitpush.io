In September 2018 I joined Debricked as the very interesting combination of a Maching Learning Engineer and Sales with the perception that the SaaS-product was "done". We just needed to add some more ML-enabeled capabilites and off we go! We were wrong.. so so wrong. 

About a year later I was recognized as a Co-Founder, and have continously thrown spaghetti \[and my head\] against the wall until this day. With a lot of detours, bad assumptions, hacky code, good code, talking to users, research, and sales we got recongnized in the industry through the accusation 3 months ago. Today, we are scaling our SaaS-growth-loop, building great products, and scaling the team, and I'd like to share some leasons learned about building a SaaS-company.


## Knowing that the unknowns are unknown

As we started out we were naive to the challenge we tried to solve. We didn't do enough research on the space, the competetive landscape, substitutes, and the direction of the market. In some ways, that was fine. We started out doing a lot of things right for the wrong reasons, simply talking to potential customers and building product. Not because we knew that would be a good strategy, rather because none of us had ever really worked at a large enterprise. It turned out that the culture to "just build things" and listening to customers was a good fit for building a deep-tech SaaS offering. 

In the first few months of our journey, we realized that a lot of our assumptions we continously made were wrong. It was not that we made illogical assumtions, but rather that it is very hard to predict what customers will love. Rather than keeping making bad predictions, we embraced that we need to accuratly figure out the unknowns by talking to customers. 

Roughly we needed to know if an \[idea, feature, pivot, etc.\] was good by figuring out if: 

0. Investors think it's a great idea (0.1%)
1. Internal or expert conviction (0.9%)
2. Research or competitors talks about this like it is important (4%)
3. Customers are indicating pain, and this \[idea, feature, pivot, etc.\] will releave it (10%)
4. Customers are responding well to the pitch (15%)
5. Customers are taling to us about this feature before we pitch (20%)
5. Customers pay largly due to this feature (50%)

The percentage is indicating the weight of importance to each point of validation.


## Capability to deliver vs. delivering 


## Measurs, Talk, Build, Repeat


## When to build with conviction 


## Focusing was painful 


## Deliver value before you capture it
