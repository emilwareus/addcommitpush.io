## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Personal & First-Person

Write from direct experience. Use "I" liberally. Share what you've actually built, failed at, and learned.

**Do:**

> "As someone who's worked as a data lead or head of engineering for the past years, I've learned a lot about finding and hiring great engineers."

> "In September 2018 I joined Debricked as the very interesting combination of a Machine Learning Engineer and Sales with the perception that the SaaS product was 'done' and ready to take on the world. We just needed to add some more ML-enabled capabilities and off we go! We were wrong.. so so wrong."

**Don't:**

> "Organizations should consider the following best practices when hiring engineers..."

### 2. Honest About Mistakes

Openly admit when you were wrong. This builds credibility and makes lessons more impactful.

**Do:**

> "We were wrong.. so so wrong."

> "If I got to re-live the beginning of our endeavor, I would have pruned these dimensions A LOT from the start."

> "In the beginning, we did not do this right."

**Don't:**

> "After careful analysis, we pivoted our strategy to better align with market conditions."

### 3. Humble but Opinionated

Take strong stances, but acknowledge you're still learning. Never position yourself as having all the answers.

**Do:**

> "I feel like Emil 2.0... It also feels like I'm level 2 out of 100, I wonder what the next thing could be ;)"

> "In my opinion, the best indicator of a good hire is a successful result from the case..."

> "This is at least the state late 2025, in a year or so... who knows."

**Don't:**

> "As industry experts, we recommend the following definitive approach..."

### 4. Give Credit Openly

When ideas aren't yours, say so explicitly. Link to sources. This shows intellectual honesty.

**Do:**

> "But first, these are not my ideas! I stole with pride! This approach was pioneered by Dex and Vaibhav from AI That Works..."

**Don't:**

> Take credit for frameworks or ideas developed by others.

## Structural Patterns

### Start with Context

Open with who you are and why you're qualified to write about this. Ground the post in real experience.

```
As someone who's worked as a data lead or head of engineering for the past years, I've learned a lot about finding and hiring great engineers.
```

### State What You'll Cover

Give readers a preview. Use a simple list.

```
I'll try to reason about:
- Knowing that the unknowns are unknown
- Capability to deliver vs. delivering
- Measure, Talk, Build, Repeat
```

### TL;DR and Key Takeaways

Include summary sections for scanners. Place them at the start OR end (not both).

```
TL;DR: Start with a noisy draft from model knowledge only. Denoise through iterative web research. Stop when findings—not the draft—are complete.
```

### "Who is this for?" Section

Define your audience explicitly. Be specific about their experience level.

```
Who is this article for?
You have already spent more on AI coding tools the last 6 months than any other tools in your 10-year coding career.
```

## Language & Vocabulary

### Use Metaphors and Vivid Language

Make abstract concepts tangible through imagery.

**Examples:**

- "throwing spaghetti [and my head] against the wall to see what sticks"
- "pushing the Great Wall of China 0.01 centimeters a day"
- "polishing a stone"
- "spinning plates"

### Casual Markers

Sprinkle in conversational phrases that feel natural, not forced:

- "so so wrong"
- "do it!"
- "that's ideal!"
- "who knows"
- "My point is..."
- "I stole with pride!"

### Technical Precision Where It Matters

When explaining technical concepts, be precise. Use code blocks, terminal examples, and exact terminology.

```
D₁ = U(D₀, R(D₀))
D₂ = U(D₁, R(D₁))
```

### Avoid Corporate Speak

Never use:

- "leverage synergies"
- "best-in-class"
- "thought leadership"
- "at the end of the day"
- "moving forward"
- "stakeholders"

## Sentence & Paragraph Structure

### Short Paragraphs

2-4 sentences max. One idea per paragraph. Let readers breathe.

### Rhetorical Questions

Use sparingly to invite reflection:

> "What if your innovation is not incremental?"

> "Do they get excited when I say we use graph databases?"

### Direct Address

Speak to the reader occasionally:

> "I urge you to click the links, and read through these commands."

> "If you got this far in my post, I'm inclined to believe that you want to start your own company someday... do it!"

### Parenthetical Asides

Add context or wit in parentheses:

> "the very interesting combination of a Machine Learning Engineer and Sales"

> "(Prevent excessive searching)"

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Lists for Actionable Items

Use bullet lists for:

- Things to look for
- Steps in a process
- Comparisons

### Tables for Comparisons

When comparing concepts, tools, or approaches, use tables:

| Classical Diffusion | Research Diffusion |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Random noise        | Initial draft      |

### Blockquotes for External Voices

Use blockquotes when citing others or emphasizing key insights:

> "The iterative nature of diffusion models naturally mirrors how humans actually conduct research—cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision."
> — Google Research

### Code Blocks for Commands and Code

Use terminal/code blocks liberally for anything executable:

```
/research_codebase
```

## Emotional Register

### Enthusiasm Without Excess

Show genuine excitement, but don't overdo punctuation or superlatives.

**Good:**

> "It was the most thrilling experience in my professional life so far"

**Too much:**

> "This is AMAZING!!! The BEST thing EVER!!!"

### Vulnerability

Share struggles and uncertainties:

> "This is something that we are still struggling with, as it's hard to ask for (and get) time from someone that had a bad experience with your tool."

### Encouragement

End on forward-looking, encouraging notes:

> "If you got this far in my post, I'm inclined to believe that you want to start your own company someday... do it!"

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't write in third person** — "The author believes..." Never.

2. **Don't hedge excessively** — Say what you think. "I think X" not "It could potentially be argued that X might be..."

3. **Don't be preachy** — Share experiences, don't lecture.

4. **Don't use emojis** — Unless explicitly requested.

5. **Don't pad content** — If you've made your point, stop.

6. **Don't over-explain** — Trust the reader's intelligence.

7. **Don't use "we" when you mean "I"** — Be specific about whose experience this is.

## Reference: Characteristic Phrases

These phrases capture the voice. Use similar constructions:

- "I look for three things..."
- "My point is..."
- "I've learned a thing or two about..."
- "With the hindsight hat on..."
- "It turned out that..."
- "To make X a part of our culture, we implemented..."
- "This maybe takes out a bit of the old 'fun' about developing, but I'm mostly excited about..."
- "In my experience..."
- "The key insight is that..."
- "I'll update this blog post when I have more to give in this area!"
