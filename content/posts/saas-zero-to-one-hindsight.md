In September 2018 I joined Debricked as the very interesting combination of a Maching Learning Engineer and Sales with the perception that the SaaS-product was "done". We just needed to add some more ML-enabeled capabilites and off we go! We were wrong.. so so wrong. 

About a year later I was recognized as a Co-Founder, and have continously thrown spaghetti \[and my head\] against the wall until this day. With a lot of detours, bad assumptions, hacky code, good code, talking to users, research, and sales we got recongnized in the industry through the accusation 3 months ago. Today, we are scaling our SaaS-growth-loop, building great products, and scaling the team, and I'd like to share some leasons learned about building a SaaS-company.  

## Knowing that the unknowns are unknown


## Capability to deliver vs. delivering 


## Measurs, Talk, Build, Repeat


## When to build with conviction 


## Focusing was painful 


## Deliver value before you capture it
