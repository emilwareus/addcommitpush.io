![About me](/images/emil_1.jpg)

Hi! 


I'm Emil Wåreus, a business savy data-nerd that spends way to much time in front of a screen. During business hours I work as the head of R&D/Data Science at [Debricked](https://www.debricked.com), the startup I founded in 2018 and sold to [Micro Focus](https://www.microfocus.com) in 2022. There I lead a small team of researchers in creating application security solutions to analyze open source. I'm also quite good at writing spaghetti code & drinking wine.

A study of papers and some of my own research on why some open source projects becomes unmaintained. You can view the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9jU4xJ03ek).

### [ How Neo4j’s Graph database can remediate vulnerabilities](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-neo4js-graph-database-can-remediate-vulnerabilities-debricked/){:target="_blank"}
How we used the Neo4j Graph database to understand how all open source uses all other open source. We then write our own graph algorithms to triverse this graph for find dependency trees safe from vulnerabilties. 

## Papers

### [Automated CPE Labeling of CVE Summaries with Machine Learning](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52683-2_1)
Open Source Security and Dependency Vulnerability Management (DVM) has become a more vital part of the software security stack in recent years as modern software tend to be more dependent on open source libraries. The largest open source of vulnerabilities is the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which supplies developers with machine-readable vulnerabilities. However, sometimes Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) have not been labeled with a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) -version, -product and -vendor. This makes it very hard to automatically discover these vulnerabilities from import statements in dependency files. We, therefore, propose an automatic process of matching CVE summaries with CPEs through the machine learning task called Named Entity Recognition (NER). Our proposed model achieves an F-measure of 0.86 with a precision of 0.857 and a recall of 0.865, outperforming previous research for automated CPE-labeling of CVEs.

### [Security Issue Classification for Vulnerability Management with Semi-supervised Learning](https://www.scitepress.org/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0010813000003120)
Open-Source Software (OSS) is increasingly common in industry software and enables developers to build better applications, at a higher pace, and with better security. These advantages also come with the cost of including vulnerabilities through these third-party libraries. The largest publicly available database of easily machine-readable vulnerabilities is the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). However, reporting to this database is a human-dependent process, and it fails to provide an acceptable coverage of all open source vulnerabilities. We propose the use of semi-supervised machine learning to classify issues as security-related to provide additional vulnerabilities in an automated pipeline. Our models, based on a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN), outperform previously proposed models on our manually labelled test dataset, with an F1 score of 71%. Based on the results and the vast number of GitHub issues, our model potentially identifies about 191 036 security-related issues with prediction power over 80%. 

This paper was nominated for best paper for the conference, but lost to other fantastic research :)

## Research Projects

### AI and Risk-based Vulnerability Management for Trustworthy Open Source Adoption, [ARVOS](https://github.com/arvos-dev)
A project for runtime vulnerability detectiong, where the project is using eBPF to track vulnerable code execution in open source projects. This is a projected backed by [Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/ai--and-risk-based-vulnerability-management-for-trustworthy-open-source-adoption-arvos/) and is executed together with  [Debricked](https://www.debricked.com) and [Elastisys](https://elastisys.com/).


### Health and Security Management in Open Source Software [HASMOSS](https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/projects/health-and-security-management-in-open-source-software)

Open Source Software (OSS) provides an important tool in the digitalization of the Swedish industry. A big challenge, however, is the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced. Through HASMOSS, we aim to enable the Swedish industry to analyze and manage this risk, and thereby create conditions for sustainable consumption and collaboration on OSS.
This is a research project together with [RISE](https://www.ri.se/en), [Debricked](https://www.debricked.com), [Scania](https://www.scania.com/), and [Addalot](https://addalot.se/).
