# Intro

Remember back in school when you had one of those infamous and dreaded group projects (I kinda liked them)... 
at least a few times you probably tried the "parrallel" way of working, optimizing for a bit less colaboration and each participant owning one segment of the report. 
Off you go! Each person for themselves writing extencive backgrounds, history, theory, or whatever sgements you decided on. Then you meet up 3 hours before the deadline to 
"glue the report" together... how did that turn out? 
The result was probably:
- Repetetive
- Inconsistant
- Different tone of voice per segment
- Vastly different quality per segement
- No the grade you hoped for


It turns out, when we construct our AI research agents like this (plan -> parrallel research -> glue research into report), we get the same problem! When no context of the "evolving report" is shared accross sub-agents, 
we get a fragmentet ball of mudd.

These sequantial and isolated group projects/research agents have their percs, like high level of autonomy and parrelelism... but there are porbably better ways to do it. 

# Diffusion Deep Research

Think of diffusion agents models like brainstorming, but instead of everyone writing their own part in isolation and building a Frankenstein report, 
the research spreads and overlaps as it evolves within the team. Ideas for each segemnt are not isolated, as not one person owns each segemnt.

The team starts off by writing a draft, only based on their internal knowledge. 
Typically in bullet point format with clear notes about missing references, knowledge gaps, outdated information, and uncertanty.

The studens prioritizes these knowledge gaps together and researches different perspectives of those gaps (in parrallel isolation) and adds them back to the report in an iterative manner as a group. 
Gradually evolving the draft to an itterativly better report, filling gaps and enriching knowledge. The draft grows to become the final report. In each writing step, the students have a clear process 
for transforming rich knowledge into a consise report that fits into the whole story they are trying to tell. 

To me, this makes a lot more sense! I'll explore the implementation details of text deffusion in this blogpost. Enjoy!
