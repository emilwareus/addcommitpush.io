## Intro
- Why can it be important with big bets in software
  - If you achieve to create something that is hard it is defensible 
  - Solving valuable problems in a non-incremental way

- Speak about my experience in the subject


If you are in the context of a small company where innovative technology is your core, a research approach could be the right way to innovate for you. Big bets can change the world; and as a tech innovator you probably have this one problem that if you solve it really well things would vastly improve for your company. This non-incremental way of solving problems is not typically what I read about in modern tech-startup-books, but I have found success in pursuing large innovation and I'd like to share my experience on the subject. 

## Why am I relevant for this? 
- Short story about me. 


## Phases:
- Start with the end ind mind

- Idea phase
- Validation
- PoC
- MVP


## Principles
- Focus at the core, leverage synergies of innovation 
- Work with smart people, and let them do their thing
- Validate fast and start small 
- Don't pay too much in sunk-cost 
- It is not a project, it's a portfolio


## Working with students
- What students are great at
- .. and not so great at
- When to work with students 
- My process

## Build with end-users in mind (and talk a lot to them!)
- Pitching as a researcher
- Learning from experts
- Show things you are ashamed of 



## Core message; the one takeaway
- Start with the end user, and understand their needs! 
- It is a portfolio of bets, how do they inter-play and what is your core? 
- Build a team of passionate and creative people, with the ability to communicate their thoughts.
